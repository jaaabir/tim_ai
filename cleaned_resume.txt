Currently, Muhammed Jaabir is working as a Research Assistant at LASIGE in Lisbon, Portugal. Here, he is developing a machine learning model to identify gait activities from limited annotated accelerometer data. His objective is to automate the data annotation process for enhanced analysis and model accuracy.Prior to his current position, Muhammed Jaabir worked as a SWE Fellow at Headstarter in New York City, USA. During his tenure, he developed and deployed four AI-powered projects successfully in four weeks. He utilized Next JS and other frameworks while following agile methodologies and incorporating CI/CD practices. Additionally, he assisted multiple startups in managing backlogs by proactively reaching out via social media.Muhammed Jaabir also interned as an Applied Scientist at Object Automation Software Solutions Pvt Ltd in Chennai, India. Here, he provided ML and DL solutions to research problems, including predictive maintenance, text summarization, Custom NER models, and time series models. He also researched and implemented a chatbot for healthcare using a knowledge graph and showcased projects to over 100 students, professors, and other guests from IIT.Another internship Muhammed Jaabir held was as a Machine Learning Engineer at Tact Labs in Toronto, Canada. In this role, he developed various ML and DL models and showcased a strong command over diverse algorithms and methodologies. He leveraged ML models to develop web apps and met all the KPIs and objectives defined by the CEO during his tenure. Additionally, he led a team of 5 for several projects.

One of Muhammed Jaabir's notable projects is U-Rankly, where he collaborated within a team of three to develop an AI-driven chatbot for university consultation. This chatbot leveraged a custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline integrated with OpenAI and Pinecone to deliver real-time, precise responses to user queries.Another project he worked on is Dementia Detection Using NN Based On Speech - Final Year Research Project UG 2023. Here, Muhammed Jaabir developed and fine-tuned diverse DL models to predict dementia based on speech patterns. He achieved a significant accuracy of over 75%, surpassing the benchmarks set by the base reference paper.Muhammed Jaabir also created a chatbot for medical assistance that takes in basic data and symptoms provided by the user to predict the probable disease by traversing a knowledge graph using Neo4j.

Muhammed Jaabir completed various online certifications such as Algorithmic Toolbox, Deep Learning Specialization, and Data Science Specialization on Coursera. He also participated in several MLH hackathons and won one intra-college coding contest during his bachelor's. Additionally, he volunteered at the Web Summit Lisbon 2024.
